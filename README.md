# CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier

Classify the dog breed given an image of the dog. Also, if given an image of a    
human, predict a dog breed resembling the human face.   

### Libraries used
  - Pytorch (torch v0.4.0)
  - OpenCV

Also, check **requirements.txt** for all other suppporting libraries.

### Technologies used

  - Convolutional Neural Network
  - OpenCV's haar cascade classifier
  
### How to quickly get started 
  - Run 
    ```sh 
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
  - Start the notebook server and launch **dog_app.ipynb**
